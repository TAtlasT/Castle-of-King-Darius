	<h1>WELCOME OH FAIR ONES, YOUR JOURNEY AWAITS!</h1>
	<p>Hello there my fellow travelers! Fancy seeing you here along this golden road that leads to the great and
	<br>only castle belonging to that of the Great King Darius. Beware of what lies ahead for this road is not for 
	<br>the weak and weary and there are many paths to partake! If you so choose you can turn back if you feel you don't have 
	<br>the chops for it but if you continue there is no turning back let alone any guarantee for your safety...</p>
