		You have been imprisoned by the Kings guard and after your trial 
		<br> was set you confessed your case. You only are in this kingdom 
		<br>in order to convince the King to give you unbridled riches. 
		<br>This does not go over well with the counsel as an outsider seeks to 
		<br>leech off of their working class. 
		<br>They sentence you to death, execution by guillotine.</p>
